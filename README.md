# shasherazi's personal website

## About

This is the source code for my personal website. I plan on using this site to showcase my projects, write articles about my favorite topics, and share thoughts on miscellaneous topics.

Rn, I'm just using plain ol' JavaScript with Parcel to bundle everything together. I'm planning on using React or Next in the future.
