        It has been a few years since I started learning to code. Looking back,
        I can see that I made a lot of mistakes. Maybe you can learn from the
        mistakes I made. Here it goes:

      <h2>1. Not following a roadmap</h2>
      <p>
        I got to know about programming through my exploration of the wide world
        of the web. I was just exploring how to make computers do different
        things, and I learned that you could do something called
        <strong>coding</strong>. I dug a bit deeper and found myself on the tip
        (exaggeration) of the computer science iceberg. CS iceberg as in
      </p>
      <p>
        <img

        />
      </p>
      <p>
        yep, there is a
        <a href="https://suricrasia.online/iceberg/" target="_blank"
          >CS iceberg</a
        >, and as you can see, there's a <strong>LOT</strong> to cover if you
        really wanna get your hands dirty.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very easy (and tempting) to get sidetracked by countlessly many
        aspects of cs. I was no exception. I started with learning Python (<a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes/dp/1718502702"
          target="_blank"
          >Python Crash Course</a
        >
        is a great book, btw) and got a <em>sense and feel</em> of how this
        coding thing works.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then I got distracted. I started learning about Qt, web, C/C++,
        ethical hacking, Java, systems programming, machine learning, computer
        vision, and many more things I don't even remember anymore. It resulted
        in a version of me that knew the bare basics of almost every cs field
        and nothing that I could actually use in a project. So, I decided that
        enough was enough. I am going to pick one thing and focus on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do programmers do when faced with a problem? They google. And so
        did I. And I hit the jackpot. Enter
        <a href="https://roadmap.sh/">roadmap.sh</a>
      </p>
      <p><img src="../../../assets/roadmap.sh-e7638c04.png" alt="roadmap.sh" /></p>
      <p>
        This open-source project has well-defined roadmaps for every major cs
        field. Choose one, and you'll emerge as a master of that field. I am
        currently following the Frontend roadmap, and I will say that it is nice
        not having to conduct extensive research on what to learn next.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, my mistake number one: not following a roadmap. I wasted a lot of
        time and energy on things that I didn't need to learn at that point. You
        can avoid this mistake by following a roadmap.
